Gratuartion Rate 1996 -2008

The source dataset (https://data.world/nces/postsecondary-completion-rates/workspace/file?filename=tabn326.10.xls) provided the information about the graduation rate of students at 4-year postsecondary institutions (cohort entry years are from 1996 through 2008). The source dataset provides the percentage of students graduating within 4, 5 and 6 years after their start year on the basis of race/ethnicity. Also, the source dataset includes more subcategories like public intuition, Nonprofit institution etc. for both male and females. I chose to present the overall/general picture of the dataset. I tried to generalize the dataset in two categories – first by race/ethnicity and second on year to year basis, which is further explained below.

The first chart (Figure -1) represents the average graduation rates from 1996 to 2008 by race/ethnicity. The source dataset contained a lot of information. Firstly, the dataset was cleaned by eliminating the less important information. Also, the columns for which most of the data was missing were removed. The final(cleaned) dataset contained: (1) Seven categories of race/ethnicity – White, Black, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaska Native, Non-Resident Alien, Asian and Unknowns (not registered in any group). (2) Graduation rate for every race/ethnicity category from 1996 to 2008, who gratuated within 4, 5 and 6 years. Further, the average of graduation rate from 1996 to 2008 was calculated for every race category. It gave statistics of the total percentages of students in each category who graduated within 4, 5 and 6 years. Finally, this data was represented using stacked bar charts, which gave a clear understanding of it. The race categories are displayed along the x-axis while the y-axis represents the graduation percentage. Each stacked bar displays the percentage of students (by race/ethnicity) who graduated within 4, 5 and 6 years represented by three different colors.

The second chart (Figure -2) displays the percentage of students graduating within 4, 5, and 6 years for each year from 1996 to 2008. More calculations were performed to represent this data. The average percentage of total students (not on the basis of race/ethnicity) graduating within 4, 5 and 6 years was calculated for each year from 1996 to 2008. This data was then plotted on a line chart. Each line displays the percentage of students who graduated within 4, 5 and 6 years for every year.

The visualization provides an overall generalized information about the graduation rates by race/ethnicity and also the total graduation rate for each year from 1996 to 2008. Color consistency is maintained throughout for better understanding. Stacked bar chart was used in the first chart to simplify comparison among each race.
